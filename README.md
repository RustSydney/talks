Rust Sydney Talks
=================

Use this repo to propose or request talks for the [Rust Sydney meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sydney/) as GitHub issues, so everyone can chime in on what they'd like to see.

*[Propose or request a talk](https://github.com/RustSydney/talks/issues/new); don't be shy* - we're a young meetup so no need to worry about making mistakes or giving/requesting a talk that's already been done!

See below for some ideas.

Proposing a talk
----------------

Got an idea for a talk? Raise an issue with the details and label it with `proposal`, and we'll work with you from there.

And yes, *speakers get ~~t-shirts~~ pyjama shirts or classy cleaning rags*! (S & XL t-shirts still available)

Talks can be anywhere from 5 mins onwards, so don't feel like you need a lot of content in order to talk (if you have more than 30 mins, it'd be best to split your content into several talks). Huon and Caspar are also happy to review your talk if you'd like that.

Requesting a talk
-----------------

Would you like to see a talk on a particular topic? Something you'd like to understand better, or an interesting area?

Raise an issue with the details and label it with `request`, and we'll see if we can organise someone to give that talk :)

What can you talk about?
------------------------

First up, there's no need to be an expert of any kind, so don't feel like you have to be in order to talk.

Secondly, you can talk about anything Rust related! Aside from looking at what other people have requested, here are some ideas:

* Rust for {Java,C++,C,Python,Ruby,Javascript,Scala,Haskell,C#,F#,whatever} developers
* Typical Rust gotchas or Rust for beginner programmers
* Understanding trickier bits of Rust the language (borrow checker, marker traits, trait objects, unsafety)
* What's new or coming up in the latest version of Rust (similar to http://this-week-in-rust.org/ )
* How to contribute to Rust community
* Demonstrate your/someone else's rust library X to solve problem Y
* Anything Cargo (tips, tricks, integration with other builds)
* The history of Rust (e.g. scrapped features, motivations, pivotal RFCs)
* Rust FFI/how to integrate with common C libraries
* Rust usage in a popular project (e.g. Servo, Piston, etc), or a project of your own (no matter how trivial!)
* Rust for gamedev/real-time/embedded systems
* How Rust and LLVM work together or how other bits of the Rust compiler work
* Embedding other languages in Rust, or embedding Rust in other languages
* Testing, benchmarking, profiling, debugging, REPL, IDE, editor experiences/tips/tricks/tools
* War stories solving bugs, compilation errors, or production experiences
* Anything else Rust-related ;-)
